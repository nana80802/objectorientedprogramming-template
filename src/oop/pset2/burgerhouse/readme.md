# Burgerhouse
Hey, FOOD!!!! 
We will build the most efficient digital burger house ever. Instead of playing with toys, we now play with logic and classes! 
## The Burgerplace
What are the abstractions involved in running a burger restaurant? There are ... There are ... And there are ... There are ... etc. First you should make sure that you solve the problem using the abstractions that you need. Start with pen and paper. 
**We don't need know the exact implementation to solve the problem, but we need to solve the problem to create the exact implementation.** But then for it to actually work, we need to think about the real *interface*. We can start however with defining the first classes we will use and basic responsibility.
The _interface_ is the "What exactly we want to do". 
What data is already supplied? There are two datasets available, a simple one and a more complicated one. Get started with the simpler one. 

## Group exercise
This is a team exercise that you can start as soon as you have finished the rock, paper,scissors. Set up a GitHub repository, take a whiteboard, and go for it :D

## Pay attention to:
Design Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle
* KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Design Patterns
* Singleton (restricts the instantiation of a class to one object)
* Chain of Responsibility (allows passing request along the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request. The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender class to the concrete classes of the receivers.)

## Where to start:
1. First we think of the abstractions involved in this game. 
2. Make sure that we solve the problem in pseudo-classes and pseudo-code. What classes are we going to need?
3. Then we can start thinking about the actual code being written.
